pygame

rotate 2d ball clockwise
ball_x = sin
ball_y = cos
    - 2 particles moving 
    - x and y axis
    - one full sin/cos cycle = 2pi 

z-axis: bigger and smaller ASCII characters
or shadow: left is dark, right is light, characters transform and grow towards right
    - characters or simple dots - pygame

change ball colour based on x position
sine wave for x position
one full rotation is two pi 
start at full left and full right position
    - meaning that cos(0) and cos(pi) are left and right respectably

from 0 to 125 in 400 steps
x = 0 - 400 as variable (in code x -200 cause starts at 200)

y is 0 - 125 variable
y = 0 + (125/(x/400)+1)
    cannot compute because devision by 0

fixed that colour is now based on the position in the sin wave and not the x position of the ball
better because ball position can be changed and color gradients will stay the same

Maybe make a for loop for creating positions of balls in cos/sin
    Put all those positions in a list for balls
    then for loop for drawing every rectangle in the list
