# multiple balls around each other like spinning 1
# have all the balls move around the center point
    # create cos sin circle ( or cos sin(sin) ) function for movement around
# scale color of balls in relation to distance of center point, maybe also exponential (faster turning grey more on the outside)
# scale size of balls with exponential function from center ball (faster getting smaller on the outside)
